# GitHub Repository Archival Checklists

 To prepare repositories for archival, users must complete the archival checklist which includes tasks to ensure proper documentation, resolve outstanding issues/pull requests, verify security compliance, and clean up repository resources.

## Tier 0-1
[BASIC_ARCHIVAL_CHECKLIST.md](./BASIC_ARCHIVAL_CHECKLIST.md) is designed for Tier 0 and Tier 1 repositories, which typically have lower activity usage, and limited community contribution. This checklist provides a lightweight review with a streamlined set of tasks.

## Tier 2-4
[COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHIVAL_CHECKLIST.md](./COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHIVAL_CHECKLIST.md) is designed for Tiers 2-4 repositories, which have higher criticality and more active user community with external contributors. This checklist provides a more thorough review of the repository.
